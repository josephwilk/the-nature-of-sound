# The Nature of Sound?

Using samples to create music you quickly learn the power of manpulating, splicing, reversing & chopping, turning a fixed sample into something dynamic. This leads quickly to an understanding that samples are data. The more we understand this data the more we increase the flexiblity of the sample as an instrument. That is the goal of this project. 

## Features of sound

`:f0`
Fundamental frequency. The musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present.

`:midi-note`
Midi note.

`:rms-amplitude`
Root mean squared amplitude. Voume.

`:spectral-centroid`
A good predictor of the brightness of a sound.

`:spectral-irregularity`
A good preditor of the noiseness of a sound.

`:spectral-inharmonicity`
The degree to which the frequencies of overtones depart from whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. 
* Bowed strong instruments ~ perfectly harmonic.
* Tuned percussion ~ nearly harmonic
* Untuned percussion ~ not harmonic.
